We have to calculate the area of a rectangle, a square and a circle. Create an abstract
class 'Shape' with three abstract methods namely 'RectangleArea' taking two
parameters, 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' taking one parameter each. The
parameters of 'RectangleArea' are its length and breadth, that of 'SquareArea' is its
side and that of 'CircleArea' is its radius. Now create another class 'Area' containing
all the three methods 'RectangleArea', 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' for printing the
area of rectangle, square and circle respectively. Create an object of class 'Area' and
call all the three methods

ans:

abstract class Shape
	{
	    abstract double RectangleArea(double length, double breadth);
	    abstract double SquareArea(double side);
	    abstract double CircleArea(double radius);
	}

	class Area extends Shape
	{
	  
	    double RectangleArea(double length, double breadth)
	    {
	        return length * breadth;
	    }

	    
	    double SquareArea(double side) 
	    {
	        return side * side;
	    }

	    
	    double CircleArea(double radius)
	    {
	        return 3.14*radius * radius;
	    }
	


	    public static void main(String[] args)
	    {
	        Area areacal= new Area();

	        double rectangleArea = areacal.RectangleArea(4,5);
	        double squareArea = areacal.SquareArea(55);
	        double circleArea = areacal.CircleArea(47);

	        System.out.println("Area of Rectangle: " + rectangleArea);
	        System.out.println("Area of Square: " + squareArea);
	        System.out.println("Area of Circle: " + circleArea);
	    }
	}
