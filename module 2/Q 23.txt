Create a class to print the area of a square and a rectangle. The class has two methods 
with the same name but different number of parameters. The method for printing 
area of a rectangle has two parameters which are length and breadth respectively 
while the other method for printing area of square has one parameter which is side 
of square.

ans:
public class Findarea {

    public void rectangle(int l, int b) 
    {
        int a = l * b;
        System.out.println("Area of the rectangle: " + a);
    }

   
    public void squre(int s) 
    {
        int a = s * s;
        System.out.println("Area of the square: " + a);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        Findarea cal = new Findarea();

        cal.rectangle(6,11); 
        cal.squre(3); 
    }
}
