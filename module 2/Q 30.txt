Create an abstract class 'Bank' with an abstract method 'getBalance'. $100, $150 and
$200 are deposited in banks A, B and C respectively. 'BankA', 'BankB' and 'BankC'
are subclasses of class 'Bank', each having a method named 'getBalance'. Call this
method by creating an object of each of the three classes. 



ans:

abstract class Bank 
{
    abstract int getBalance();
}

class BankA extends Bank 
{
    private int balance = 100;

    int getBalance() 
    {
        return balance;
    }
}

class BankB extends Bank 
{
    private int balance = 150;
    
    int getBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }
}

class BankC extends Bank 
{
    private int balance = 200;


    int getBalance()
    {
        return balance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
       
        BankA bA = new BankA();
        BankB bB = new BankB();
        BankC bC = new BankC();

        System.out.println("Balance in Bank A: $" + bA.getBalance());
        System.out.println("Balance in Bank B: $" + bB.getBalance());
        System.out.println("Balance in Bank C: $" + bC.getBalance());
    }
}
