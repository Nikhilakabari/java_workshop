Create a class named 'Shape' with a method to print "This is this is shape". Then
create two other classes named 'Rectangle', 'Circle' inheriting the Shape class, both
having a method to print "This is rectangular shape" and "This is circular shape"
respectively. Create a subclass 'Square' of 'Rectangle' having a method to print
"Square is a rectangle". Now call the method of 'Shape' and 'Rectangle' class by the
object of 'Square' class.

ans:

class Shape2 
{
    void displayShape()
    {
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape2 
{
    void displayRectangle() 
    {
        System.out.println("This is a rectangular shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape2
{
    void displayCircle()
    {
        System.out.println("This is a circular shape.");
    }
}


class Squre extends Rectangle 
{
    void displaySquare() 
    {
        System.out.println("Square is a rectangle.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        Squre s1 = new Squre();

        s1.displayShape(); 
        s1.displayRectangle(); 
        s1.displaySquare(); 
        
    }
}
